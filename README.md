# SlowFood - API
## Revisarik

## Description
This application is an API for the website [revisarik](https://revisarik.netlify.app/) which is a made-up online pizzeria. the API provides the site with the ability to store a registered user's login credentials, store objects (in the form of a pizza) that have a title, content, price and a category it belongs to. 

Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.
